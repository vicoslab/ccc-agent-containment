# ccc-agent architecture: trust boundaries and contained roots

This document covers the runtime mechanics. The accepted cross-repo design
lives in the workspace root (`CCC_AGENT_BRANCHFS_PROTECTION_REVIEW_DESIGN.md`);
this is the implementation view.

## Trust split

```text
untrusted: the agent process tree (codex/claude/hermes/... and children)
trusted:   ccc-agent run / ccc-agent / ccc_agent (supervisor)
           branchfs daemon + store
           ccc-fuse-sidecar (privileged FUSE broker)
```

The supervisor launches the agent inside a **rootless bwrap sandbox** (no extra
container privilege); bwrap is part of the untrusted-launch boundary, not a
privileged component.

The agent can *produce branch deltas*. Only the supervisor can freeze,
inspect, commit, or abort them. This holds because:

1. agent-visible paths are BranchFS **agent mounts** (`--agent`): the
   `.branchfs_ctl` control file and `@branch` virtual dirs are not exposed;
2. the BranchFS store (deltas, tombstones, metadata, `daemon.sock`) lives
   outside the agent view — commit requests are only accepted over that
   socket;
3. session state (`<state_dir>/<session-id>/session`), review artifacts,
   mountpoints, and per-turn control sockets are grouped under one
   `<state_dir>/<session-id>/` bundle outside the view and additionally covered
   by the `.ccc-agent` deny pattern;
4. hooks invoke `ccc-agent finish-turn` (records an event) and
   `ccc-agent check-before-final` (reads live status; exit 2 asks the
   agent to revert policy violations, bounded by
   `max_policy_repair_attempts`) — there is no hook path that freezes or
   commits.

## Session lifecycle (process-exit completion, first milestone)

```text
created -> mounting -> running -> finalizing -> frozen
        -> auto-committed | pending-review | committed | aborted | failed
```

- `ccc-agent run` materializes one branch per protected root (branch name =
  session id), mounts agent views, runs the command with
  `CCC_AGENT_SESSION` set, and finalizes on exit.
- If a node/container reboots while a session is `running`, `ccc-agent resume
  <session>` reuses the existing branch bundle, re-mounts the saved roots, runs
  the stored `agent_command` by default (or a custom command after `--`), and
  then follows the same process-exit finalization path. Resume does not create a
  new branch and custom resume commands do not overwrite the stored original
  exec.
- Freeze happens **after** completion — and, for harnesses with blocking
  Stop hooks, after the bounded self-repair loop (`check-before-final`) has
  allowed the stop — then `branchfs status --json` per root feeds the policy
  engine.
- `pending-review` keeps branches frozen; the branchfs daemon may exit (it
  auto-exits with its last mount) — `ccc-agent commit/abort SESSION [SESSION ...]`
  re-ensures it from session metadata (`branchfs start-daemon --base ... --storage ...`).
- Commit failures never abort: the branch is preserved and the session is
  marked `failed` for manual recovery.
- Nested agents: a shim or `ccc-agent run` invoked with `CCC_AGENT_SESSION`
  already set reuses the outer session — one review unit per task, no branch
  explosion.

## Contained root layout (bwrap mode)

`ccc_agent.runner._bwrap_command` builds a bubblewrap invocation that assembles
a rootless user+mount+pid namespace — no container `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, just
unprivileged user namespaces. The agent runs as the calling uid mapped to 0
inside the namespace; the namespace (and all its mounts) disappears with the
agent process. Layout the agent sees:

```text
/usr /etc /opt                    read-only binds of the container image
/bin /sbin /lib /lib64            recreated as the host's usrmerge symlinks
/proc                             bound from the container (bwrap_proc_mode:
                                  bind|ro; "fresh" needs systempaths=unconfined)
/dev                              bwrap minimal nodes
/tmp                              fresh tmpfs (session-scoped)
/run                              existing container runtime namespace (rw bind
                                  by default; omitted with --full-isolation or
                                  container_run_access=false)
/storage/user                     BranchFS agent view (rw) — overlays + hides
                                  the real underlay at the same path
/home/<user>                      same view or its home_subdir (rw)
~/.codex ~/.claude ~/.hermes      direct shared rw binds over the home view
                                  (default agent/system state, not BranchFS)
/ccc-agent/plugins/…              CCC agent plugin root (ro) when supported
~/.codex/plugins/ccc-agent       Codex plugin scan path (ro bind on top of
                                  shared ~/.codex when Codex requires it)
/run/ccc-agent/control.sock       per-turn control socket (per-turn mode)
```

The CCC agent plugin is a **read-only** bind of root-owned package assets,
injected only for a contained run of the matching agent (Claude `--plugin-dir`,
Codex in-sandbox plugin path, Hermes `HERMES_BUNDLED_PLUGINS`). The untrusted
agent can load it but never edit the hook source. Agent tool homes (`~/.codex`,
`~/.claude`, `~/.hermes`) are direct shared rw binds by default, outside BranchFS
commit/review/rollback. Set `protect_agent_state: true` or run with
`--protect-agent-state` to omit those binds and make the user handle any
agent-state merges through BranchFS review. A failed/missing plugin degrades to
process-exit review — it never grants commit authority. See
`docs/agent-integration.md`.

Deliberately absent: real `/storage/*` underlays (the view `--bind` overlays
the visible path), the BranchFS store, `daemon.sock`, the supervisor state dir,
and any other `/storage` mount. `/home/$USER` and `/storage/user` bind the
**same** view (alias rule), never two branches.

The container's existing `/run` is **not** treated as data that ccc-agent must
hide by default. CCC containers already isolate `/run` from the host unless the
container deployment intentionally exposes a socket. Therefore bwrap mode binds
container `/run` into the sandbox by default so agents can use container-provided
runtime services such as Docker, ssh-agent, or other sockets when that container
has them. This is an intentional escape-capability tradeoff: a powerful socket
such as Docker or the FUSE sidecar may let an agent reach data paths outside the
BranchFS view. That risk is considered deployment-authorized system access, not
a violation of ccc-agent's primary goal (protect and review normal writes to
`/home`/`/storage`). For stricter containment, run `ccc-agent run
--full-isolation` or set `container_run_access: false`; that restores the older
no-ambient-`/run` behavior aside from ccc-agent's own control socket.

The agent gets a scrubbed environment (`--clearenv` + an explicit `--setenv`
allowlist). No network or proc isolation is enforced by design; the boundary
is filesystem confinement plus PID-namespace process isolation, not a full
container-escape prevention boundary.

In **`none` mode** (debug only) the agent runs with its cwd inside the mounted
view but nothing else isolated — **not a security boundary**: absolute-path
writes go straight to the real underlay and bypass the view. Use it only to
exercise the policy/commit pipeline without bwrap.

## FUSE plumbing

Normal CCC app containers have no `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; BranchFS mounts go through
`ccc-fuse-sidecar`:

```text
branchfs (unprivileged, in-container)
  -> fusermount3 shim                  (PATH-installed by CCC base image)
  -> /run/ccc-fuse-sidecar/fuse.sock   (host sidecar, SYS_ADMIN)
  -> /dev/fuse open + mount(2), fd passed back SCM_RIGHTS
```

The sidecar stays policy-free. Path translation between the container and
sidecar namespaces is the sidecar's Docker-inspect mode (see that repo's
README); BranchFS mountpoints under the per-session
`<state_dir>/<session-id>/mounts/...` bundle must resolve to the same host paths
in both namespaces or be translated.

## Runtime validation

Everything in `tests/` runs without FUSE. End-to-end validation needs a host
with `/dev/fuse` (via `ccc-fuse-sidecar`) and unprivileged user namespaces
(e.g. `donbot-domen-cuda10`):

```bash
# bwrap confinement, real FUSE, full commit/review cycle:
scripts/test-e2e-bwrap.sh      # in-scope auto-commit, out-of-scope pending,
                               # /usr read-only, underlay + store hidden
# debug pipeline without a sandbox:
scripts/test-e2e-none.sh
```

bwrap's only host requirements are an unprivileged-userns-capable kernel and
the `bwrap` binary (`bwrap_bin` in config). A *fresh* `/proc` (`bwrap_proc_mode:
fresh`) additionally needs the container's `/proc` masks cleared
(`--security-opt systempaths=unconfined`); otherwise use the default bound
`/proc`.
