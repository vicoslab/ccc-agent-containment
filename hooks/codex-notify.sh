# Codex `notify` adapter for CCC agent sessions.
#
# Codex has no Claude-style Stop hook; instead it calls a `notify` program with
# a single JSON event argument on certain events (notably agent-turn-complete).
# Register it in ~/.codex/config.toml (or via -c):
#
#   notify = ["/opt/ccc-agent/hooks/codex-notify.sh"]
#
# On turn completion this signals end-of-turn to the supervisor over the control
# socket, which commits the turn's in-scope changes.
#
# IMPORTANT LIMITATION: codex ignores the notify program's exit code and does
# NOT wait on it, so — unlike the Claude Stop hook — it CANNOT block the turn
# for out-of-scope approval.  For codex, out-of-scope changes are therefore
# deferred to session-end review (pending-review) rather than prompted mid-turn.
# Use `codex exec` (one turn per process) or Claude Code if you need the
# blocking per-turn approval flow.
