# CCC contained-session Stop-hook adapter (Claude Code / Codex plugin).
#
# Loaded ONLY inside a bwrap-contained CCC session: ccc-agent run injects the
# enclosing plugin read-only and points the agent at it (Claude --plugin-dir,
# Codex sandbox plugin scan). A direct `claude`/`codex` run never sees it.
#
# Hooks are best-effort turn-boundary SIGNALS. They never freeze, commit, or
# abort -- commit authority lives in the trusted supervisor outside the
# sandbox, and process-exit finalization is the authoritative fallback. Every
# failure path here degrades safely (exit 0, never block) so a broken/old hook
# contract can only cost per-turn convenience, never containment.
